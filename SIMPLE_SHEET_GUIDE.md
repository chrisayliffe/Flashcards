```
     A          |        B              |        C              |      D        |    E    |    F    |  G  |    H
-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------|---------|-----|----------
  Type           | Column2              | Column3              | Column4       | Column5 | Column6 |Col7 | Column8
  flashcard      | Hvað heitir þú?      | What's your name?    | Greeting      |         |         |     |
  flashcard      | Góða nótt            | Good night           | Nighttime     |         |         |     |
  flashcard      | Takk fyrir           | Thank you            | Polite        |         |         |     |
  mcq            | Translate: Sandra    | Ég heiti Sandra      | Þú heitir...  | Hann... | Við...  |  1  | Hint
```

## 🎨 Key Points:

✅ **Column A = Type** (flashcard, mcq, fill-blank, or image)  
✅ **Row 1 = Headers** (the app ignores this row)  
✅ **Row 2+ = Your content**  
✅ **Empty cells are OK** (for optional fields)  
✅ **For MCQ: Answer is 1-4** (which option number is correct)

---

## ❓ Quick Troubleshooting:

**Problem:** App shows "Using fallback data"  
**Solution:** Make sure:
- Tab is named exactly "Lesson 1"
- Sheet is public (Share → Anyone with link)
- Column A has "flashcard" or "mcq" (lowercase)
- You have data starting in Row 2
