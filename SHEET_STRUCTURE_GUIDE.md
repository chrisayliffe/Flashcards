# üìù EXACT Google Sheet Setup - Step by Step

## üéØ Your Sheet is Currently Empty - Here's How to Fill It!

Your Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1meQLVv9Un4CvIYWwq5lFZZx1wvnp0APh_m8dAyl0rGk/edit

---

## Step 1: Rename the Tab

1. At the bottom, you'll see a tab called "Sheet1"
2. **Right-click** on "Sheet1"
3. **Select "Rename"**
4. Type: **"Lesson 1"** (exactly like this)
5. Press Enter

---

## Step 2: Set Up Column Headers (Row 1)

Click on each cell in Row 1 and type these headers:

### For Flashcards and Questions Together:

| Cell | What to Type |
|------|-------------|
| **A1** | Type |
| **B1** | Column2 |
| **C1** | Column3 |
| **D1** | Column4 |
| **E1** | Column5 |
| **F1** | Column6 |
| **G1** | Column7 |
| **H1** | Column8 |

**Why generic names?** Because different card types use different column meanings. The app knows what each column means based on the "Type" in column A.

---

## Step 3: Add Your First Flashcard

Now start in Row 2:

| Cell | Type This | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **A2** | flashcard | This tells the app it's a flashcard |
| **B2** | Hva√∞ heitir √æ√∫? | The Icelandic text |
| **C2** | What's your name? | The English translation |
| **D2** | Common greeting question | The hint (optional) |
| **E2** | https://yourdomain.com/audio.mp3 | Audio file URL (optional) |

**Leave F2, G2, H2 empty** - flashcards only use columns A-E.

---

## Step 4: Add More Flashcards

Continue in Row 3, 4, 5, etc.:

**Row 3:**
- A3: `flashcard`
- B3: `G√≥√∞a n√≥tt`
- C3: `Good night`
- D3: `Nighttime farewell`
- E3: (leave empty if no audio)

**Row 4:**
- A4: `flashcard`
- B4: `Takk fyrir`
- C4: `Thank you`
- D4: `Essential polite phrase`
- E4: (leave empty)

---

## Step 5: Add a Multiple Choice Question

Let's say Row 5:

| Cell | Type This | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **A5** | mcq | Multiple choice question |
| **B5** | Translate to Icelandic: My name is Sandra | The question |
| **C5** | √âg heiti Sandra | Option 1 (correct answer) |
| **D5** | √û√∫ heitir Sandra | Option 2 |
| **E5** | Hann heitir Sandra | Option 3 |
| **F5** | Vi√∞ heitum Sandra | Option 4 |
| **G5** | 1 | Which option is correct (1 = first option) |
| **H5** | '√âg heiti' means 'I am called' | Hint (optional) |

---

## Step 6: Add a Fill-in-the-Blank Question

Row 6:

| Cell | Type This | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **A6** | fill-blank | Fill-in-the-blank type |
| **B6** | Fill in the blank: G√≥√∞an _____ | The question |
| **C6** | daginn | The correct answer |
| **D6** | This means 'Good morning' | Hint (optional) |

**Leave E6-H6 empty** - fill-in-blank only uses columns A-D.

---

## Step 7: Add an Image Selection Question

Row 7:

| Cell | Type This | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **A7** | image | Image selection type |
| **B7** | Select the image that represents: G√≥√∞a n√≥tt | The question |
| **C7** | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1472214103451-9374bd1c798e?w=400 | Image 1 URL (moon) |
| **D7** | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1470252649378-9c29740c9fa8?w=400 | Image 2 URL (sun) |
| **E7** | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506905925346-21bda4d32df4?w=400 | Image 3 URL (mountain) |
| **F7** | https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1441974231531-c6227db76b6e?w=400 | Image 4 URL (forest) |
| **G7** | 1 | Which image is correct (1 = first image) |
| **H7** | 'G√≥√∞a n√≥tt' means good night | Hint (optional) |

3. **Start your data in Row 2**
4. **For MCQ and Image: Answer is 1-4, NOT 0-3**
   - If Option 1 is correct, put "1" in column G
   - If Option 2 is correct, put "2" in column G
5. **Empty cells are OK** - leave optional fields blank
6. **No extra spaces** - "flashcard" not " flashcard "
